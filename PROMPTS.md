## CLI-Backed Prompts (Commerce Engine)

These prompts trigger the TypeScript scanner under the hood. The agent auto-resolves project path, engine, and flags — **you never need to type CLI commands**.

### Basic Scans

| Prompt | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `scan my project` | Auto-detect platform, run full code audit |
| `scan my project and name it "Acme"` | Audit with named report title |
| `scan only the Checkout and Payment modules` | Filtered audit (specific modules only) |
| `scan only the Custom namespace` | Filtered audit (specific namespace) |

### With Data Inputs

| Prompt | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `scan my project with DB dump at /path/to/dump.sql` | Code + database schema analysis |
| `scan with BRD impact analysis using /path/to/requirements.docx` | Code + BRD requirement mapping |
| `scan with bug report from /path/to/bugs.xlsx` | Code + bug cascade/severity analysis |
| `run full scanner with DB at /db.sql, BRD at /brd.docx, bugs at /bugs.xlsx` | All analysis layers combined |

### Targeted / Partial

| Prompt | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `just run BRD analysis from /spec.docx, skip the code scan` | BRD-only (no code audit) |
| `analyze patch upgrade impact from 2.4.7-p7 to 2.4.7-p9` | Patch breaking-change analysis |
| `export scan results as JSON` | Machine-readable output (for CI pipelines) |

### Compound (multiple inputs in one prompt)

| Prompt | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `full audit named "Client X" with DB at /db.sql and BRD at /spec.docx` | Named audit + DB + BRD |
| `scan Checkout module, include bugs from /bugs.xlsx, output JSON` | Module filter + bugs + JSON |
| `audit Payment namespace with database from /prod.sql` | Namespace filter + DB |

### When Agent Asks for Clarification

| If you say... | Agent will ask... |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "scan with database" (no path) | "Path to your DB dump file (.sql)?" |
| "run BRD analysis" (no path) | "Path to your BRD document?" |
| "scan with bugs" (no path) | "Path to your bug report (.xlsx)?" |
| "audit this" (ambiguous mode) | "Which mode? Scanner / Deep Audit / Full?" |

### Utility

| Prompt | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `what engines are available?` | Lists all registered audit engines |
| `show current audit config` | Displays active configuration |
